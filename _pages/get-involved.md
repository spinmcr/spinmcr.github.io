# Get involved with SPIN

Thank you for showing interest in helping us support people in need. Our work is only possible through the help we receive from our volunteers and the generous donations we get.

To get involved you are free to choose your level of commitment.

## Be a volunteer

Be a volunteer and come help set up and serve food the street kitchen or help with the cooking at the Well ([where is the Well?](/what-we-do#how-to-get-to-the-well)). You're free to come whenever you have some spare time.

## Be a team member

Be a team member and become more committed to SPIN's mission. You'll be added to the SPIN team page where you can participate more actively in events, give your ideas and play a bigger part in the charity.

This includes helping out at the [Street Kitchen](/what-we-do#the-street-kitchen) and at [the Well](/what-we-do#the-rehabilitation) on a regular basis. Be it in rehabilitation activities, cooking or fixing up the Well. No matter what you choose to do, your work will be highly rewarding as you will be helping those without a roof to receive a nice hot meal and/or to get back into society.

## Be a fundraiser

Help us raise funds through whichever means is best for you to do so. We are currently not receiving enough funds to operate at the scale and speed we would need to. Hence, this role is highly important for the future of SPIN.
