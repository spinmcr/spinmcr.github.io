# We are SPIN

We are a charitable organisation based in Manchester, tackling the ongoing issue of homelessness and poverty.

## Our beginnings

SPIN started in 2014 when two brothers took it upon themselves to collect food that would otherwise be thrown away by supermarkets and restaurants and distribute it to the homeless in Manchester. 

Walking all around Manchester to deliver hot food gradually brought the idea of a static street kitchen. Through the network they developed they eventually made it into a reality. However, it didn't stop there, as they were soon offered a project by the pastor of a local dilapidated church in Ardwick, to regenerate said church into a sanctuary for the homeless.

With the selfless help and hard work of our volunteers, SPIN took shape and became the organisation you know today.

## Our mission

To provide restaurant standard food and drinks served at a street kitchen in Manchester City Centre on a weekly basis. To manage and maintain a safe and warm haven for those on the street with no hope and no help to start their journey back into normal civilisation. To provide them with the opportunities and the tools to get back into full-time work and to manage their own accommodation and lifestyle.

## The team

SPIN would not be possible without the help and support of our volunteers.
