# What we do

Here at SPIN we put our best efforts into tackling the ongoing issue of homelessness and poverty. We do so by both providing hot meals to those living in the street, and shelter and support during their rehabilitation at our base.

## The street kitchen

The SPIN Street Kitchen is our main event and happens **every Thursday** at 7:45pm **behind the Manchester Cathedral**. Here we provide hot restaurant-standard meals to those who need it. It's cooked at our base, the Well, and delivered straight to our waiting friends along with some tea, coffee and desserts.

Through [FareShare](http://fareshare.org.uk) we collect surplus food from supermarkets and restaurants that would otherwise be thrown away, and provide it to our homeless friends.

### How to get to the street kitchen

You will find us behind the Cathedral, next to the river.

## The rehabilitation

We are based at The Well, a Baptist Church that has kindly offered to collaborate with SPIN by **providing beds and shelter** for our homeless friends. It's usually pretty busy here, but more so on a Thursday before the Street Kitchen and on Sundays for the weekly Sunday Roast.

Through the kind **donations** of people and companies such as Kellogg's, we are able to **provide computers and internet access** to our guests in order to help them **write a CV, look for jobs and preparing for interviews**.

However, in order to further our goal of providing educational inductions and workshops we need your help!
