# What we do

Here at SPIN we put our best efforts into tackling the ongoing issue of homelessness and poverty. We do so by both providing hot meals to those living in the street, and shelter and support during their rehabilitation at our base.

## The street kitchen

The SPIN Street Kitchen happens every Thursday behind the Manchester Cathedral, where we provide hot restaurant-standard meals to those who need it. It's cooked at our base and delivered straight to our waiting friends, along with some tea, coffee and desserts.

We could really do with your support:

	<a href="#"	style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" class="btn btn--primary btn--large">Volunteer</a>
