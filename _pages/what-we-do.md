# What we do

SPIN's main activity is supporting and educating our residents at the Well in order to get them back into working society. We also serve a delicious Sunday roast, where restaurant-quality food, cooked by experienced chefs, is prepared for rough-sleepers and those living in dire poverty.

Food, clothes and toiletries are given out during the Sunday roast, and throughout the week. SPIN also manages the ongoing activities and projects at the Well, a church currently housing 12 homeless, 6 of which have found full-time jobs in the past 4 months thanks to our hardworking volunteers.

As a condition of providing accommodation and food, our homeless friends have to volunteer for [FareShare](http://fareshare.org.uk),thereby establishing a work routine to get them ready for a working life.

## The Sunday Roast

SPIN organises a Sunday Roast **every Sunday** at 1:00pm **at The Well**, in Ardwick. Here we provide hot restaurant-standard meals, cooked by experienced chefs, to those who need it. Along with the hot meal, visitors also get hot tea, coffee and delicious desserts.

Through [FareShare](http://fareshare.org.uk) we collect surplus food from supermarkets and restaurants that would otherwise be thrown away, and provide it to our homeless friends.

We also count with very generous donations from establishments such as Greggs.

## The Big Change

SPIN is currently partnering with the Big Change to provide said residents with funds to aid in their transition.

## The rehabilitation

We are based at The Well, a Baptist Church that has kindly offered to collaborate with SPIN by **providing beds and shelter** for our homeless friends. It's usually pretty busy here, but more so on a Monday before the Soup Kitchen and on Sundays for the weekly Sunday Roast.

Through the kind **donations** of people and companies such as Kellogg's, we are able to **provide computers and internet access** to our guests in order to help them **write CVs, look for jobs and preparing for interviews**.

However, in order to further our goal of providing educational inductions and workshops we need your help!

### The NHS Wellbeing project

The Wells grounds are getting an amazing makeover thanks to the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. 

SPIN, with the help of the homeless guys at the well, Sow Manchester, the brilliant and creative [Louella Lily FitzGerald](https://www.facebook.com/louella.fitzgerald) who designed all features of the garden, will be working together to make the well grounds beneficial to all the community.

This will especially benefit people with mental health issues. The features include wildlife ponds, chickens, polly tunnel and even a willow arch leading to a peace garden. There is too much to mention but we will be updating. If this kind of thing floats your boat and would like to get involved give us a shout.
