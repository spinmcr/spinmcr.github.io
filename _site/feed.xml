Read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a new SPINer in the house, and it’s a truly barking resident. SPIN (original name Robbo) is a dog whose previous owner passed away recently, leaving his companion homeless. He’s been with us for two months now, and seems to be settling in really well. We’re so happy we were able to save this little one off the street, giving him a safe and loving home. Welcome to the family SPIN!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/spin-dog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-right&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adele and Wendy (which you know to be one of our most devoted and welcoming volunteers) continue with their outstanding slim-raiser, helping end homelessness through weight loss success. To date, our amazing duo have lost over 4 stone between them, raising £852 of their £1,000 target, and pledging to meet the sponsor money if they don’t reach it. We couldn’t be prouder to have these incredible ladies as a part of our SPIN community; congratulations on your incredible work, and all the press mentions you’ve got!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can contribute towards their fundraiser here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we went through our drawers (or drives, more like it), and found some of our old blog posts, focusing on a day-to-day running of the Well. If you fancy a little trip to the past, exploring SPIN’s big (but also the small) moments, enjoy our time capsule here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, The Well have started hosting a BINGO night on a Monday which gives residents chance to socialise in a calm and relaxed atmosphere. The recent addition to The Well’s schedule has been a success and it’s great to see a smile on many of the faces of our residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/31253129_312902629240436_1470105002625204224_n.jpg?w=288&amp;amp;h=216&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of The Well’s residents put on their gloves and cleaned the allotment earlier today. This was followed by planting some flowers, designing the above pattern on the front garden and removing any rubbish from the surrounding area. All part of turning The Well into a home for its residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local mobile hairdresser, Suzie kindly donated her Sunday afternoon to voluntarily cut the hair of The Well’s residents. Milan once again got a new trim and some of the women loved the opportunity to go for a new style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike arrived at The Well six weeks ago after finding himself in uncertain circumstances and consequently homeless. We have been able to provide Mike with a full-time job and temporary accommodation at The Well. Here is a picture from his first day as he’s enjoying a breakfast before cycling to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We at SPIN just wanted to share these photos as it’s really heartwarming to see guys completing domestic duties who were previously on the streets several weeks ago. They are cleaning the dishes, hoovering and generally keeping everything in order to turn The Well into their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/homeless-12345.jpg?w=288&amp;amp;h=384&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the holiday season, SPIN are back to business and hoping to get more guys off the street with accommodation and volunteering opportunities. The Well’s had further success with FareShare as six of the residents found full time work and moved into their own flats. Our ambition is to surpass this in the new year by housing more vulnerable individuals and providing more opportunities for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milan’s first piece is now ready for sale as part of The Well’s furniture restoration project. Thanks to all those who donated the tools to make the project possible as it further develops the skills of our homeless friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Samantha Thomas Berry who donated Black &amp;amp; Decker power tools to The Well earlier today for Milan’s furniture restoration project. This can further develop the skills of our residents which will only increase their employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have started to distribute Christmas hampers amongst many vulnerable families in the Greater Manchester region. I was shocked to hear that both parents work full time with two young children but still require that little bit of extra support from local charities. The current government has a lot to answer for when you’re distributing hampers to parents who have both a home and are working full-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark, Milan and several others hosted another fundraising session at Tesco’s Prestwich branch earlier today. We hosted a raffle and discussed SPIN’s progress to many of the customers doing their afternoon shopping. It was a really great afternoon for both raising SPIN’s profile and raising considerable donations for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/tesco-12345.jpg?w=288&amp;amp;h=384&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this afternoon, Adele and Mark were distributing flyers for The Well’s Christmas dinner which will be funded by Connolly’s Builders. This is one of many attempts by SPIN to combat the issues of loneliness specifically amongst the elderly and to ensure everyone is enjoying Christmas dinner with either acquaintances or family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this evening at Manchester Cathedral, SPIN had the pleasure of the WYWAM samba troupe entertaining our guests. Many of the customers danced to the various rhythms and enjoyed the show. The customers also enjoyed fish and chips followed by mince served with onions and potatoes. It was also great to see some familiar faces return including Becky and her friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the beginning of the weekend and many of The Well’s residents have decided to relax after voluntary placements at Fareshare. The community enjoyed soft drinks whilst playing computer games, challenging each other to games of pool and watching television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the weekend, The Well entertained several Cantonese visitors who helped prepare a meal and provided entertainment for the residents. One of our residents, Danny has also been able to contact his family and they agreed to meet at The Well for a Sunday dinner. This is part of the progressive journey for many of our guests as they attempt to reconcile with their family and improve their self-esteem before finding the confidence to get their life back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPIN had a really pleasant evening as the customers enjoyed the Sausages and Mash prepared earlier at The Well. We’d like to thank Jenny, Kate and Patrick for volunteering in the kitchens all day. Simon from FareShare also made an appearance and helped serving the desserts to the customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to all volunteers for sparing your Thursday night to help Manchester’s homeless community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to local donations, we were able to take Milan for a haircut at Martin’s Barbers in Platt Fields. The new look really improved his self-esteem which has provided the confidence to continue pursuing jobs and building his life in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/milan-haircut-123.jpg?w=288&amp;amp;h=384&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve just welcomed George to The Well with this selection of toiletries and a cooked meal. He’s been sleeping on the streets for years and had tragically been set on fire by a group of youths over the weekend. He’s been given shelter by SPIN and found sanctuary at The Well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark attended an audience with Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burham earlier today. We were given the chance to show a video of SPIN’s progress to the politician who was extremely pleased with the charity’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several members of Costa’s Head Office visited The Well earlier today who delivered the exciting news that there will be jobs in the pipeline for several of its residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of The Well’s residents volunteered at FareShare earlier today. Their duties included packaging the food, storing the food in the vans and later transporting them to various hostels around Manchester. This was great work experience for many of the residents in a warehouse which has benefited their CV, self-esteem and two residents have already gained full-time employment through this route with FareShare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the options of mash and gravy. The customers loved chatting with the guests who provided counselling and re-assurance that local communities can provide a helping hand. As always, thank you to the regular guys who donate to SPIN and for generally being amazing selfless people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Well was visited by Cloverdale Christian Church earlier today and their gospel choir performed for the residents. Nick Carr-Brown also led the service and he was later joined by the local children with a sermon for the congregation. The atmosphere was loving, inspiring and came to a close with a serving of Chicken Kiev and chips. It’s a blessing to be part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice is rarely seen on the frontline but participates in all the ‘best’ jobs such as cleaning the dishes, preparing the meals and cleaning the bathrooms for thirteen hairy males at The Well. As a sign of appreciation, she was treated to pampering day by one of our volunteers where she enjoyed an Italian meal and purchased a dress alongside a pair of new shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our organisation, SPIN were kindly invited to Kellogg’s volunteering event based at their headquarters in Stretford. This was a resounding success as the cereal conglomerate kindly donated ten laptops which will enable SPIN to set up an IT class at The Well. This will particularly help foreign migrants and refugees who will be able to contact their loved ones at home. SPIN also plan to take full advantage of the laptops by setting up an IT class to perhaps teach the basics of Microsoft Office, set up social media profiles or improve CVs for any residents who aren’t computer literate in this digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18118840_1860480117560244_323036836011593708_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;amp;oh=6205b753846d5c73c54c1ca49dad1808&amp;amp;oe=5B60F3C9&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPIN enjoyed another Sunday afternoon at our summer sanctuary of The Well. We luckily had a local schoolgirl provide entertainment by showcasing her drumming skills for the residents. The kitchen staff also prepared a roast dinner and the residents enjoyed a selection of donuts provided by a local Gregg’s. This was followed by relaxing on the terrace in the sunshine during the afternoon, as shown in the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After last week’s relatively quiet evening, there was a worrying increase in numbers at tonight’s Soup Kitchen. Many of the customers enjoyed the Sweet Chilli Chicken and socialised with other members of the community. KEY 103 also kindly donated a large amount of sandwiches which were distributed amongst the customers and we welcomed a new recruit Catherine to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suitably celebrated Easter with a service this morning followed by a selection of mini eggs and cakes for the children. Later in the day, one SPIN member also prepared a meal for an elderly woman, without any relatives, who would have otherwise celebrated the event alone. This is possibly worth bearing in mind as one small gesture can go a long way for the lonely and disadvantaged in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/house.jpg?w=233&amp;amp;h=311&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-relatively-quiet-night-at-the-cathedral&quot;&gt;A relatively quiet night at the Cathedral&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/food-hall.jpg?w=207&amp;amp;h=276&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer seems to be approaching and this allowed the customers to enjoy their food as the sun set over Manchester. The kitchen welcomed around 50 customers and they particularly enjoyed the chicken curry on-offer. The relatively quiet night allowed volunteers to chat with the clients, particularly about the Spice epidemic, which is sweeping Manchester and how it’s frightening for the homeless communities due to the lack of resources or rehabilitation available. We resolved that we can only be optimistic that there will continue to be more organisations such as SPIN and the local communities within Manchester will pull together to help the disadvantaged addicted to this terrifying drug during this uncertain time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/shredded-chicken.jpg?w=369&amp;amp;h=276&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This client’s backstory perfectly epitomises SPIN’s ethos as he was sleeping in a tent in the city centre several months ago. Following a caring hand from SPIN and some power tools, the individual has been able to harness his talents and contribute to The Well’s renovation which will provide shelter for many of Manchester’s homeless in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We delivered another food parcel to a grandmother is unfortunately acting as a carer to her three grandchildren whilst her mother is attempting to combat some health problems. Get in touch (via the blog or Facebook) if you know someone who is also struggling to feed their children and could benefit from a similar parcel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPIN started preparing for this evening’s kitchen earlier this afternoon as the kitchen staff cooked ‘Bangers and Mash’ whilst several volunteers boxed Marks and Spencer’s  donations of chocolate bars. The evening had an impressive turnout and several of the customers enjoyed the brews and biscuits on-offer due to the chilly temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/brew.jpg?w=330&amp;amp;h=248&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the earlier AGM, SPIN now exists in a legal capacity and the minutes are available to read for anyone who’s interested. We also discussed the constitution during the AGM and planned how we wish to build and improve SPIN over the next year. We also elected new trustees for the charity and it seems like there will be a promising twelve months ahead for SPIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the cold temperatures, there was another impressive turnout at Macclesfield’s Soup Kitchen on the 15th March. Many of the customers enjoyed the chicken curry and socialising with others where they were able to shoot the breeze about common experiences or share information about local accommodation. The evening was very humbling for the volunteers but it’s great to see an organisation such as SPIN challenging the issue of homelessness in the Greater Manchester region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us are doing this challenge to try and give something back to the communities that helped us – we are all either once homeless or addicts/alcoholics in recovery (or both), and we understand more than most just how important not only the practical side of what we do is – the food parcels, the bedding, the clothes, the help to access to the correct services, but also the importance of the human side – the support, the friendship, the knowing that even in the darkest times of life, somebody cares. We are doing this challenge to help provide for more people who are struggling in the hardship of their current life situation and to show the unity of bringing people and organisations together to help other people. Anything you can spare to support us is gratefully received and appreciated more than you know. Thank you from all of us. Xxx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat Less Feed More is a campaign that aims to raise £1000, 100% of which will be used to help and support the homeless living in the streets of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

We at SPIN are fortunate enough to be in the midst of a finalist for the much coveted Volunteer Of The Year Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/be-proud/mark-award-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-left&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Evans, co-founder of SPIN, was nominated by A Connolly Ltd (based in Wigan) for his exceptional generosity, selflessness and motivation when it comes to helping the destitute and those in need. Not only has he established a street kitchen with his brother, John, that delivers restaurant quality food on a weekly basis but also co-created a sanctuary for those that need a roof over their head and to get off the streets in our emergency homeless shelter, The Well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Mark has contributed to taking 20 people off the streets, finding permanent jobs for 7 homeless folks and helping to overcome substance abuse with weekly AA meetings held at The Well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, Mark volunteers a lot of his time delivering food parcels to people in Manchester which cannot afford to provide for themselves. His undiminishing drive to help those in need sees him helping collect food for FareShare - one of Manchester’s biggest food banks based in Smithfield Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/be-proud/john-and-mark-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-right&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dressed up to the nines, Mark, John (his brother and Co-Founder of SPIN), and Adele (nominator from A Connolly Ltd and volunteer at SPIN) attended the glittering gala dinner and awards ceremony in Manchester Town Hall’s Great Hall where they brushed shoulders with other finalists, nominators and sponsors. A well deserved change for a man that gives everything he can to help others; a man that expects nothing in return for his generosity; a humble man that just wants to do good for those without the opportunity to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Mark on being recognised for all of your fantastic work.

&lt;p&gt;Good day,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing as a member of a not for profit, grass roots organisation striving to provide the most basic human rights to those on the streets and/or in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our organisation is called Supporting People In Need (SPIN). We began over two years ago when our founders Marc and John, two brother from Manchester, took it upon themselves to walk the streets of this beautiful city handing out sandwiches, hot drinks and clothing to the destitute. Due to an injury suffered whilst serving for our national armed forces, John was unable to continue to take to the streets and began plotting a stationary street kitchen with Marc. With a lot of hard graft the lads were able to make that dream come true and to this day &lt;strong&gt;upwards of 50 visitors come and indulge on a three course, restaurant standard of food&lt;/strong&gt; outside the Manchester Cathedral &lt;strong&gt;every Thursday night&lt;/strong&gt;. We provide a gorgeous variety of foods, hot/cold drinks and snacks as well as clothing, an ear to bend and a warm, caring connection from a genuine bunch of volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with this, a local parish saw the great work the boys were doing and wanted to help. The Coverdale Church on Coverdale Close, Ardwick was a dilapidated, rat infested building fit only for demolition until it was offered to SPIN. The Pastor always had the dream of creating a sanctuary for those without permanent housing to come worship, eat, relax and sleep as well as &lt;strong&gt;providing a stepping stone for those on the streets to progress back in to society&lt;/strong&gt;; either &lt;strong&gt;through overcoming substance abuse&lt;/strong&gt;, volunteering to actually &lt;strong&gt;finding jobs&lt;/strong&gt; and giving control back to the destitute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a lot of hard work Marc, John and a whole host of generous volunteers helped to transform this battered building into The Well, a fully functioning church with an industrial kitchen, full sized canteen, games/entertainment room and 12 beds which are all currently occupied by those seeking refuge from the harsh streets of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jamie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-left&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At The Well, those who are offered sanctuary must volunteer some of their time to maintaining and managing the facilities. In addition to this, they spend time working for a local food charity called FareShare Greater Manchester which was launched in October 2008 to support communities to combat food poverty and food waste in and around Manchester. The guys who give time to FareShare receive food parcels in exchange for their time and as a thank you FareShare donate a very generous amount of food to The Well which is used to feed those staying, the surrounding community (Sunday roast dinner) and the food kitchen on a Thursday night. &lt;strong&gt;SPIN&lt;/strong&gt; has additionally been &lt;strong&gt;very successful in finding jobs for some&lt;/strong&gt; of the occupants of The Well including warehouse work, retail and catering works to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is currently no other self funded, not for profit charity doing as much as we are in Manchester&lt;/strong&gt;. Feeding, homing and finding jobs for the destitute. A lot of the funds have either come from the pockets of the patriots running the organisation or from donations as well as some money from the church funds itself. We have plans to expand the living quarters so we can house more seeking sanctuary but we are running low on funds. If you can help by donating whatever you can in order to make The Well a success then you’ll be helping those within the walls of the sanctuary but also hundreds, even thousands of people on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;
