Adele and Wendy are of the most active volunteers at SPIN. They always greet you with a smile and are driven to help those in need.

So driven in fact that **they're willing to loose 4 stone minimum** between them by the 8th of July in order to **raise money for the homeless** of Manchester.

Eat Less Feed More is a campaign that aims to raise Â£1000, 100% of which will be used to help and support the homeless living in the streets of Manchester.

They are already 60% of the way there, both in weight-loss and fundraising.

> We have pledged that if we don't complete this by the 8th July we will match fund the donations
