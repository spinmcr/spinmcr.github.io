Updates From The Well. Read on!
 
We have a new SPINer in the house, and it’s a truly barking resident. SPIN (original name Robbo) is a dog whose previous owner passed away recently, leaving his companion homeless. He’s been with us for two months now, and seems to be settling in really well. We’re so happy we were able to save this little one off the street, giving him a safe and loving home. Welcome to the family SPIN!

Adele and Wendy (which you know to be one of our most devoted and welcoming volunteers) continue with their outstanding slim-raiser, helping end homelessness through weight loss success. To date, our amazing duo have lost over 4 stone between them, raising £852 of their £1,000 target, and pledging to meet the sponsor money if they don't reach it. We couldn’t be prouder to have these incredible ladies as a part of our SPIN community; congratulations on your incredible work, and all the press mentions you’ve got! 

You can contribute towards their fundraiser here:

Last but not least, we went through our drawers (or drives, more like it), and found some of our old blog posts, focusing on a day-to-day running of the Well. If you fancy a little trip to the past, exploring SPIN’s big (but also the small) moments, enjoy our time capsule here:
