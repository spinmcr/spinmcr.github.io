# Eyes Down for The Well – Bingo followed by an evening meal

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/31252862_312902755907090_4622724535349673984_n.jpg?w=288&h=216){: .align-center}

Over the last few months, The Well have started hosting a BINGO night on a Monday which gives residents chance to socialise in a calm and relaxed atmosphere. The recent addition to The Well’s schedule has been a success and it’s great to see a smile on many of the faces of our residents.

# Generous Green Fingers

Several of The Well’s residents put on their gloves and cleaned the allotment earlier today. This was followed by planting some flowers, designing the above pattern on the front garden and removing any rubbish from the surrounding area. All part of turning The Well into a home for its residents.

A local mobile hairdresser, Suzie kindly donated her Sunday afternoon to voluntarily cut the hair of The Well’s residents. Milan once again got a new trim and some of the women loved the opportunity to go for a new style.

Mike arrived at The Well six weeks ago after finding himself in uncertain circumstances and consequently homeless. We have been able to provide Mike with a full-time job and temporary accommodation at The Well. Here is a picture from his first day as he’s enjoying a breakfast before cycling to work.

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/homeless-1234.jpg?w=288&h=384){: .align-center}

We at SPIN just wanted to share these photos as it’s really heartwarming to see guys completing domestic duties who were previously on the streets several weeks ago. They are cleaning the dishes, hoovering and generally keeping everything in order to turn The Well into their home.

# Further success with FareShare

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/volunteers.jpg?w=353&h=265){: .align-center}

Following the holiday season, SPIN are back to business and hoping to get more guys off the street with accommodation and volunteering opportunities. The Well’s had further success with FareShare as six of the residents found full time work and moved into their own flats. Our ambition is to surpass this in the new year by housing more vulnerable individuals and providing more opportunities for work.

<br/>
# Furniture Restoration Project

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/milan.jpg?w=369&h=277){: .align-center}

Milan’s first piece is now ready for sale as part of The Well’s furniture restoration project. Thanks to all those who donated the tools to make the project possible as it further develops the skills of our homeless friends.

# Further donation of power tools for The Well

Thanks to Samantha Thomas Berry who donated Black & Decker power tools to The Well earlier today for Milan’s furniture restoration project. This can further develop the skills of our residents which will only increase their employment opportunities.

# Christmas Hampers

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/christmas-hamper.jpg?w=311&h=233){: .align-center}

We have started to distribute Christmas hampers amongst many vulnerable families in the Greater Manchester region. I was shocked to hear that both parents work full time with two young children but still require that little bit of extra support from local charities. The current government has a lot to answer for when you’re distributing hampers to parents who have both a home and are working full-time.

# 12th December 2017 – Tesco fundraising session

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/tesco.jpg?w=288&h=384){: .align-center}

Mark, Milan and several others hosted another fundraising session at Tesco’s Prestwich branch earlier today. We hosted a raffle and discussed SPIN’s progress to many of the customers doing their afternoon shopping. It was a really great afternoon for both raising SPIN’s profile and raising considerable donations for future projects.

# Connolly’s Christmas Dinner at The Well

Earlier this afternoon, Adele and Mark were distributing flyers for The Well’s Christmas dinner which will be funded by Connolly’s Builders. This is one of many attempts by SPIN to combat the issues of loneliness specifically amongst the elderly and to ensure everyone is enjoying Christmas dinner with either acquaintances or family.

During the weekend, The Well entertained several Cantonese visitors who helped prepare a meal and provided entertainment for the residents. One of our residents, Danny has also been able to contact his family and they agreed to meet at The Well for a Sunday dinner. This is part of the progressive journey for many of our guests as they attempt to reconcile with their family and improve their self-esteem before finding the confidence to get their life back on track.

Our organisation, SPIN were kindly invited to Kellogg’s volunteering event based at their headquarters in Stretford. This was a resounding success as the cereal conglomerate kindly donated ten laptops which will enable SPIN to set up an IT class at The Well. This will particularly help foreign migrants and refugees who will be able to contact their loved ones at home. SPIN also plan to take full advantage of the laptops by setting up an IT class to perhaps teach the basics of Microsoft Office, set up social media profiles or improve CVs for any residents who aren’t computer literate in this digital age.

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/shephards-pie.jpg?w=284&h=213){: .align-center}

After last week’s relatively quiet evening, there was a worrying increase in numbers at tonight’s Soup Kitchen. Many of the customers enjoyed the Sweet Chilli Chicken and socialised with other members of the community. KEY 103 also kindly donated a large amount of sandwiches which were distributed amongst the customers and we welcomed a new recruit Catherine to the team.

# Easter at The Well

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/easter-chocolate.jpg?w=236&h=315){: .align-center}

We suitably celebrated Easter with a service this morning followed by a selection of mini eggs and cakes for the children. Later in the day, one SPIN member also prepared a meal for an elderly woman, without any relatives, who would have otherwise celebrated the event alone. This is possibly worth bearing in mind as one small gesture can go a long way for the lonely and disadvantaged in society.

# A relatively quiet night at the Cathedral

Summer seems to be approaching and this allowed the customers to enjoy their food as the sun set over Manchester. The kitchen welcomed around 50 customers and they particularly enjoyed the chicken curry on-offer. The relatively quiet night allowed volunteers to chat with the clients, particularly about the Spice epidemic, which is sweeping Manchester and how it’s frightening for the homeless communities due to the lack of resources or rehabilitation available. We resolved that we can only be optimistic that there will continue to be more organisations such as SPIN and the local communities within Manchester will pull together to help the disadvantaged addicted to this terrifying drug during this uncertain time.

# From being homeless to building homes…

This client’s backstory perfectly epitomises SPIN’s ethos as he was sleeping in a tent in the city centre several months ago. Following a caring hand from SPIN and some power tools, the individual has been able to harness his talents and contribute to The Well’s renovation which will provide shelter for many of Manchester’s homeless in the future.

We delivered another food parcel to a grandmother is unfortunately acting as a carer to her three grandchildren whilst her mother is attempting to combat some health problems. Get in touch (via the blog or Facebook) if you know someone who is also struggling to feed their children and could benefit from a similar parcel.

SPIN started preparing for this evening’s kitchen earlier this afternoon as the kitchen staff cooked ‘Bangers and Mash’ whilst several volunteers boxed Marks and Spencer’s  donations of chocolate bars. The evening had an impressive turnout and several of the customers enjoyed the brews and biscuits on-offer due to the chilly temperatures.

We are also desperately in need of a plumber and joiner to finalise a few things – if anyone could spare a few hours – please get in touch.

# Great news – SPIN now exists in a legal capacity.

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/agm.jpg?w=336&h=252){: .align-center}

Following the earlier AGM, SPIN now exists in a legal capacity and the minutes are available to read for anyone who’s interested. We also discussed the constitution during the AGM and planned how we wish to build and improve SPIN over the next year. We also elected new trustees for the charity and it seems like there will be a promising twelve months ahead for SPIN.

# Celestial Cakes for the Church

Mark delivered a selection of cakes and pastries earlier this afternoon to the Church of Nazerine. They were all pleased with the donation of cakes from SPIN and later enjoyed the sweet treats with a brew.

# 15th March 2017 – Food Kitchen in Macclesfield

![image-center](https://supportingpeopleinneed.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/curry.jpg?w=266&h=200){: .align-center}

Despite the cold temperatures, there was another impressive turnout at Macclesfield’s Soup Kitchen on the 15th March. Many of the customers enjoyed the chicken curry and socialising with others where they were able to shoot the breeze about common experiences or share information about local accommodation. The evening was very humbling for the volunteers but it’s great to see an organisation such as SPIN challenging the issue of homelessness in the Greater Manchester region.

# Climbing for Charity

All of us are doing this challenge to try and give something back to the communities that helped us – we are all either once homeless or addicts/alcoholics in recovery (or both), and we understand more than most just how important not only the practical side of what we do is – the food parcels, the bedding, the clothes, the help to access to the correct services, but also the importance of the human side – the support, the friendship, the knowing that even in the darkest times of life, somebody cares. We are doing this challenge to help provide for more people who are struggling in the hardship of their current life situation and to show the unity of bringing people and organisations together to help other people. Anything you can spare to support us is gratefully received and appreciated more than you know. Thank you from all of us. Xxx
